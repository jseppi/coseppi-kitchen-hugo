    Black Bean Muffins

Sweetened bean dishes are unusual in Western cuisine but they are quite popular in Asia. We had some black bean pudding left over after making _frejol colado_ and this little experiment is what happened. Turned out pretty well!

### Ingredients

  * 2 cups cooked black beans
  * 1/2 cup almond milk
  * 1/4 cup vegetable oil
  * 1 tablespoon lemon juice
  * 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
  * 2 whole eggs
  * 1/2 cup raw sugar
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1 teaspoon ground cloves
  * 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
  * 1 cup flour
  * 1/2 cup shredded coconut

### Preparation

  1. Combine beans, almond milk, vegetable oil, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and eggs in a blender. Blend until thoroughly combined and the beans have been pureed.
  2. Pour black bean mixture into a large bowl and stir in sugar, salt, salt, cloves, cinnamon, flour, and coconut.
  3. Scoop batter into muffin cups and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.
  4. If you&#8217;d like, top with an icing of your choice.  We made this simple icing, but flavored it with ground cloves: <a title="Simple Icing" href="http://www.thekitchn.com/simple-solutions-how-to-make-a-94001" target="_blank">http://www.thekitchn.com/simple-solutions-how-to-make-a-94001</a>
