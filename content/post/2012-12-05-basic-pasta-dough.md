This is a simple, no-frills recipe for pasta dough.  It is easiest made in a stand-up mixer, but can also be made by hand.  If you are so inclined, you can also add chopped herbs or other spices to make flavored pasta.

### Ingredients

  * 4 egg yolks
  * 3 tablespoons olive oil
  * 1 pound unbleached flour
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * warm water

### Preparation

  1. In the bowl of the stand-up mixer with a hook attachment, combine flour, egg yolks, oil, and salt on the lowest-speed setting.
  2. While mixing, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until a dough ball forms.  You will probably need somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3 cups of water.  You don&#8217;t want the dough to be smooth and not sticky. If you add too much water, don&#8217;t worry! &#8212; just sprinkle in some more flour.
  3. Remove the dough from the mixer and knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes.
  4. Let the dough rest in a covered, lightly floured bowl in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before using.  If you&#8217;d like to store the dough longer, wet the surface with a small amount of olive oil and keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Makes slightly over 1 pound of dough.
