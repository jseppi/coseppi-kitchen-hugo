### Ingredients

  * 1 1/2 cups long grain brown rice
  * 2  tablespoon vegetable oil, divided
  * 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
  * 1 teaspoon ginger, minced
  * 1 teaspoon garlic, minced
  * 2 tablespoons gluten-free soy sauce
  * 1 cup broccoli, chopped
  * 1 cup purple cabbage, shredded
  * 2 carrots, chopped
  * 1 cup mushroom, sliced
  * 1 egg, beaten (optional)
  * 1/4 cup spring onions, sliced
  * 1/4 cup parsley, chopped
  * 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
  * 1/4 cup mint, chopped

### Preparation

  1. Prepare the rice in a rice cooker or on the stove top as directed.
  2. Optional: Whisk the egg vigorously and scramble in a large frying pan or wok with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. When the egg is thoroughly cooked remove from the pan and set aside.
  3. Add the remaining vegetable oil and sesame oil to the hot pan. Saute the ginger, garlic, green onions, and mushrooms until the spices are softened and aromatic and the mushrooms have expelled their liquid, about 3 minutes.
  4. Add the vegetables and saute until the broccoli is bright green and tender, about 3 minutes.
  5. Add the cooked rice, soy sauce, and herbs until well heated.
  6. Optional: Stir in cooked eggs.
  7. Serve hot with your favorite _ají_ (try our [Chifa Style Ají][1]).
