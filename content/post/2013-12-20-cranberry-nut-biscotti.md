### Ingredients

  * 1/4 cup vegan butter
  * 2/3 cup turbinado sugar
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 2 teaspoons baking powder
  * 2 tablespoons egg replacer
  * 2 1/2 cups almond flour
  * 1 cup rice flour and extra for rolling
  * 1/3 cup fresh orange juice
  * 1/2 teaspoon orange bitters (optional)
  * 1/2 teaspoon orange zest
  * 1 cup fresh cranberries, chopped
  * 1 cup pecans, chopped

### <span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Preparation</span>

  1. In a medium bowl, combine salt, baking powder, egg replacer, almond flour, and rice flour.
  2. In a large bowl or mixer blend vegan butter, sugar, orange juice, bitters, and orange zest.
  3. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet. When the dough is consistent add the chopped cranberries and pecans.
  4. With rice-floured hands, roll the dough into two-inch wide rolls with flattened ends.
  5. Place these rolls onto well-oiled cookie sheets and bake  for 15 minutes at 375 degrees.
  6. Remove the pans and reduce the oven heat to 300 degrees.
  7. Allow the rolls to cool on a rack for about 15 minutes, then cut the rolls into 1/2-inch wide slices to make the cookies. Place the cookies back on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake until golden brown on the bottom, about 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the cookies and brown the other side.
  8. Cool the cookies on racks to keep them dry, then store in an airtight container for up to two weeks.
