<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">2014 has proven to be a very busy year for us at Coseppi but I am happy to share the good news that our hard work is paying off. We should be moving in to our new and completely renovated house later this month and my work as the Executive Director of </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://farmshareaustin.org/">Farmshare Austin</a> <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">is keeping me busy this summer with a major fundraising push.<a href="{{% mediaroot %}}uploads/2014/07/farmraiser-flyer-final-black.jpg" rel="lightbox[3765]"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3767" alt="farmraiser flyer final (black)" src="{{% mediaroot %}}uploads/2014/07/farmraiser-flyer-final-black-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a></span>

Farmshare is a new 501c3 dedicated to helping new organic vegetable growers succeed in this challenging field. This year we have secured a location for the educational farm, hired a wonderful farm manager and lead instructor to develop the program, and opened the application process for our first class of students. Â In the next few months we will be working very hard to raise the remaining capital needed to build a classroom, furnish student housing, and provide scholarships.
