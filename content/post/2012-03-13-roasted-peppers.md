  In my opinion, all peppers taste better if they have been roasted. Roasting adds depth to the flavor of mild or sweet peppers and it helps mellow the heat in spicy peppers.

### Ingredients

  * Peppers of your choice
  * Olive or vegetable oil cooking spray

### Utensils

  * Knife
  * Baking sheet
  * Air-tight container

### Preparation

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Prepare the peppers by removing the caps and seeds.  Cut in half if appropriate for your recipe.
    </li>
    <li>
      Arrange the peppers (cut side down) on the baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spray the skins of the peppers lightly with the cooking spray.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the peppers in the oven and broil on high (about 500 degrees Fahrenheit) until the skins have blackened.  Pay close attention here because you can easily burn the peppers too much. If using whole peppers, you might need to flip them partway through the roasting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Carefully transfer the hot peppers to an airtight container and allow them to steam themselves and cool for 10-15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove and discard the pepper skins. The roasted peppers are now ready to use or consume.
    </li>
  </ol>

    Tip: You can roast a variety of different peppers at the same time, but keep an eye on the smaller ones. They may blacken faster and need to be removed from the oven sooner. You want the skins to char, not the flesh!
