</div>

### Ingredients

  * 1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and boiled
  * 1/8 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, chopped
  * 1/4 pound sweet peppers, chopped
  * 1 large sweet onion, chopped
  * 3 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1/2 tablespoon hot pepper flakes
  * 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
  * 1 cup cooked black-eyed peas
  * 3/4 cup vegetable broth
  * 1 tablespoon rice flour
  * 1/2 cup unsweetened plain soy milk
  * 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  * 1 teaspoon ground sage
  * Salt and pepper to taste
  * 1/4 cup walnuts, chopped

### Preparation

  1. In a large pot, heat olive oil and saute onion over medium-low heat until fragrant. Add garlic, mushrooms, peppers, and hot pepper flakes and continue sauteing until peppers soften, about 4 minutes.
  2. Add parsley and black-eyed peas and combine with sauteed vegetables over medium-high heat. Add broth and rice flour stirring until thoroughly combined, then allow liquid to come to a simmer. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper to taste, and place in a deep casserole dish and set aside.
  3. In a medium bowl, use a hand mixer to whisk potatoes with  soy milk, soy sauce, and ground sage until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  4. Spread mashed sweet potatoes on top of the filling and place in an oven heated to 350 degrees. Bake until the filling simmers and the potatoes develop a slightly golden crust, about 30 minutes.
  5. Let cool for about 10 minutes and consider serving with [walnut gravy][1].
