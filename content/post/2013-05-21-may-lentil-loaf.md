### Ingredients

  * 1 cup lentils
  * 4 cups vegetable stock or broth
  * 1 medium onion, diced
  * 2 &#8211; 3 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1/2 pound carrots, grated
  * 1/2 pound celery root, grated
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 1 cup gluten-free oats, powdered (use a food processor)
  * 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
  * 3 tablespoons ground flax mixed with 1/2 cup water
  * 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped
  * 2 tablespoons fresh sage leaves, chopped
  * salt and pepper to taste

#### For the topping sauce

  * 1/2 cup whole canned tomatoes, chopped
  * 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  * <p style="display: inline !important;">
      1 tablespoon molasses
    </p>

  * <p style="display: inline !important;">
      1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
    </p>

  * 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

### Preparation

  1. Bring broth to boil, add lentils, and reduce heat to simmer until the lentils are tender and have absorbed most of the broth, about 25 minutes.
  2. While the lentils cook, start the sauce in a medium sauce pan by heating the tomatoes, tomato paste, molasses, vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Simmer over medium-low heat until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.
  3. Saute the onion and garlic in olive oil over medium high heat until tender, about six minutes.
  4. Add grated celery root  and carrot to the sauteed onions, and continue cooking for another two to three minutes. Incorporate the walnuts and herbs, then remove from heat.
  5. Transfer the saute to a large bowl. Add powdered oats, soaked flax seeds, and cooked lentils. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  6. Press the mixture into a greased loaf pan and top with the prepared sauce.
  7. Bake for 25 &#8211; 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Serve warm with vegetable sides.
