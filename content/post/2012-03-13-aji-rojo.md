This simple pepper sauce (known as an _ají_ in South America) is a great table condiment and will add a hint (or a punch!) of spiciness to your next meal.

### Ingredients

  * 1 pound fresh red peppers, veined and chopped (a mix of both hot and sweet, depending on your preference)
  * 2 cloves garlic, chopped
  * 3 teaspoons key lime juice (about 3 limes&#8217; worth)
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * water
  * 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
  * 1/4 cup diced scallions or green onions
  * salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation

  1. In a blender or food processor, combine peppers, garlic, key lime juice, and olive oil. Puree until smooth, adding just enough water (usually about 1/4 cup) to encourage blending.
  2. Transfer puree to a bowl and add cilantro, green onions, and salt and pepper.  Mix until incorporated.
  3. Serve with your next meal!

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.
