### Ingredients

  * 2 1/2 pounds tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed, cut into quarters or eighths (about 10 cups)
  * 6 whole habanero peppers
  * 3-6 whole large cloves garlic, sliced
  * 1 tablespoon cumin seed
  * 3 cups distilled white vinegar or cider vinegar
  * 3 cups water
  * 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sea salt
  * 2 tablespoons sugar

### Preparation

  1. Divide tomatillos among 6 pint-size (2-cup) canning jars or similar-size tempered-glass or heatproof-plastic containers with lids. Divide the habaneros, garlic slices and cumin seed evenly among the jars.
  2. Combine vinegar, 3 cups water, salt and sugar in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and stir until the salt and sugar dissolve. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
  3. Carefully fill jars (or containers) with brine to within 1/2 inch of the rim, covering the tomatillos completely. (Discard any leftover brine.)
  4. Place the lids on the jars (or containers). Refrigerate for at least 24 hours before serving. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
