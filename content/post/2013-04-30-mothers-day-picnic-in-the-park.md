Having trouble thinking up plans to treat Mom for **Mothers&#8217; Day** (it&#8217;s coming up very soon &#8211; May 12)?  How about preparing a nice picnic lunch at your local city or state park to enjoy the nice spring weather!  The Texas Parks and Wildlife Division has put up some resources for to help plan your picnic in <a title="Texas State Parks Picnicking" href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/state-parks/parks/things-to-do/picnicking-in-state-parks" target="_blank">Texas State Parks</a>.  TPWD has even put together a page of <a title="TPWD Picnic Recipes" href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/state-parks/parks/things-to-do/picnic-recipes" target="_blank">picnic-friendly recipes</a>, two of which from yours truly at Coseppi Kitchen!
