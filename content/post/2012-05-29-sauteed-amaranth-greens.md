Amaranth, generally grown for its superfood-quality seeds, also produces delicate and delicious edible greens.  Amaranth greens, with their colorful leaves containing dashes of phytonutrient-rich purple and red are also quite healthy, and they&#8217;re attractive to boot.  These greens can be used as a substitute for spinach in many cooked dishes or raw salads.  This recipe keeps it simple and is a nice easy introduction for those who are new to amaranth greens.

### Ingredients

  * 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 2 cloves garlic, diced
  * 1 bunch amaranth greens, coarsely chopped
  * 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  * dash of red pepper flakes (optional)
  * salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation

  1. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy pan.
  2. Once the oil is hot and moves freely around the pan, add the diced garlic.  Saute for about 30 seconds.
  3. Add the amaranth greens and stir frequently until they are wilted, about 4 minutes.
  4. Add the balsamic vinegar and red pepper flakes, tossing the greens a few more times to distribute the vinegar and pepper.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
  5. Remove the cooked greens from heat and serve immediately.
