_Tomatillos  _are a type of fruit closely related to tomatoes with similar uses. Two good things to know about _tomatillos_ is that the husk is inedible and that the outside of the fruit inside the husk may be a little slimy to the touch. This doesn&#8217;t mean the fruit is bad, just that you may want to wash it before using.

For me, there are two major differences between _tomatillos_ and tomatoes. First, _tomatillos_ have less acid and I describe them as tart and fruity compared to tomatoes which are (at least in my vocabulary) bright and savory. Second, _tomatillos_ are high in pectin which is the same carbohydrate that is used as a gelling agent in most jellies and jams. So, again, comparing them to tomatoes, if you use _tomatillos_ in a salsa or stew they will have a somewhat thicker consistency, whereas tomatoes are typically juicier.

If you are buying fresh _tomatillos_ make sure that they are firm and that the color, typically green, is vibrant. You may also be able to find whole or crushed _tomatillos_ canned. These can be good for some recipies, but as usual, I prefer the fresh fruit.
