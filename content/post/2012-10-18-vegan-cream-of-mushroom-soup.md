    Cream of Mushroom Soup
  </p>
</div>

### Ingredients

  * 3/4 pound white potatoes, peeled and chopped
  * 2 cups vegetable broth
  * 1 tablespoon non-margarine butter substitute
  * 8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced
  * 1 large leek, finely chopped
  * 1 large clove garlic, minced
  * 1/2 cup plain, unsweetened almond milk
  * 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce (gluten-free if required)

### Preparation

  1. Bring potatoes and broth to a boil in a medium sauce pan until tender, about 15 minutes.
  2. While potato is boiling, melt the butter substitute over medium heat in a large pot.
  3. Add leeks, mushrooms, and garlic, stirring to coat. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until mushrooms have expressed their liquid and the leeks are soft, about 8 minutes.
  4. Once potatoes are soft, add the potatoes and broth to the saute and combine. Add almond milk and soy sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  5. Transfer mixture to a blender and combine until smooth, about 45 seconds.
  6. Serve warm.
