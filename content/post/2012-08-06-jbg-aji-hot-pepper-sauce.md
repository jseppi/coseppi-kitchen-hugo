This Peruvian-inspired hot pepper sauce, or [_ají_][1], is a great way to add some tangy heat to your meals.  _Aj_íe_s_ are commonly used as a tabletop condiment, but they also make a nice spicy base for sautes and stir fries.  As a commenter below pointed out, _aji__ _is actually the word for a species of chili pepper, but we found the term to be used pretty interchangeably for any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aji_(food)" target="_blank">pepper-based spicy table condiment</a> in Peru and Ecuador.

We made this _ají _with seasonal peppers, including serranos, <a title="Hinkelhatz" href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/programs/ark_product_detail/hinkelhatz_hot_pepper/" target="_blank">hinkelhatz</a>, and sweet Ringos, from <a title="JBG" href="http://jbgorganic.com" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garden</a> in Austin, TX.  We seeded about half of the hot peppers, but feel free to seed more if you don&#8217;t like a lot of heat, or less if you like more!

### Ingredients

  * 6 ounces mixed hot peppers, topped and (optionally) seeded
  * 1 large Ringo pepper, chopped (or half of a yellow bell pepper) and seeded
  * 2 medium cloves garlic
  * 1/4 cup key lime juice
  * Salt to taste

### Preparation

  1. Combine peppers, garlic, and lime juice in a food processor or blender and process until thoroughly chopped.
  2. Season to taste, but be careful because those tastes will be hot!

Store in a glass container for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator (though you&#8217;ll probably use it up before then).
