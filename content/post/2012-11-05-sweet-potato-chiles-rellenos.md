These baked chiles rellenos pair the creamy sweetness of sweet potatoes with the smoky heat of poblano peppers.  We used smaller, almost bite-size poblanos and served these as an appetizer at a recent gathering, but larger poblanos would work well for entree portions.  Either way, serve these with our [Cilantro Lime Aioli][1] for a delicious treat!

### Ingredients

  * 2 pounds poblano peppers
  * 2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * 1/2 large yellow onion, chopped finely
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground cumin
  * 1/4 cup diced tomatoes
  * 1 cup bread crumbs
  * 1 cup corn meal
  * 1 cup unsweetened milk substitute (soy, coconut, almond, etc)
  * cooking spray
  * salt to taste

### Preparation

  1. Top, seed, and roast the poblanos. See our [Roasted Peppers][2] post for instructions.  You might want to wear gloves if you are sensitive to hot peppers (or prone to touching sensitive areas!).
  2. Boil the sweet potatoes in lightly salted water until they are soft, about 25 minutes.
  3. Saute the garlic and onion in olive oil on medium heat until the onions just begin to brown, about 10 minutes.
  4. Combine the sauteed ingredients with the boiled sweet potatoes and ground cumin.  Mash together and season with salt to taste.
  5. In a large shallow bowl, combine the cornmeal and breadcrumbs along with about 1 teaspoon of salt.
  6. Lightly coat the baking sheet with cooking spray.
  7. Stuff each roasted poblano with the mashed sweet potato mixture.
  8. Dip each stuffed pepper into the milk substitute and then roll in the breadcrumb/cornmeal mixture until coated. Place each chili relleno on the baking sheet.
  9. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes until the breading becomes lightly browned.
