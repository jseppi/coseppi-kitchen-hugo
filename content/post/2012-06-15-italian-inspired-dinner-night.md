With all the fresh squash, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, basil, onions, and garlic in season right now, it is time for some delicious Italian-inspired dinners. To capitalize on this most flavorful of seasons we started our cooking marathon by creating a slow fresh tomato sauce complemented with a little spice and some meaty mushrooms in this [Garden Marinara][1]. To accompany the sauce we prepared a [Spaghetti Squash][2] infused with fresh rosemary. At their peak freshness, winter squashes are so sweet and flavorful it makes an ideal substitute for pasta or other less nutritious starches. To fully round out this feast we made [Baked Eggplant][3]. This is a stunningly good vegan baked alternative to eggplant parmesan that makes you wonder how the story of Italian cuisine would have evolved if Marco Polo had also chosen to pack some Panko back from Asia.
