On Saturday night we attended a beer tasting party at a friend&#8217;s house. Everyone attending the party brought two 20 ounce bottles of a favorite craft beer to share and everyone was able to sample and document beers they may not have tried before. These are a great way to get together, drink beer, and pretend that the beer drinking is part of a scientific process. For us, it is a great way to drink with friends and test new recipes.

    The Lineup

At this gathering we debuted [Quick Radish & Cipilloni Pickles][1], [Tomato and Feta Crostini][2], and [Black Bean Toquitos][3] with [Mango Avocado Salsa][4] and [Smoky Black Bean Dip][5]. Pickles have become popular on small plate menus in bars around Austin and we found that this recipe paired well with the <a href="http://www.trappistwestmalle.be/en/page/tripel.aspx" target="_blank">Westmalle</a> _Belgian Triple_ (Trappist Belgian Tripel),  <a href="http://www.clownshoesbeer.com/" target="_blank">Clown Shoes Brewery</a> _Brown Angel_ (American Brown Ale__), and <a href="http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/" target="_blank">Harpoon</a> _100 Barrel Series_ (Black IPA). Tomato and Feta Crostini are really savory and flavorful which we enjoyed with rich malty beers like <a href="http://www.lagunitas.com/" target="_blank">Lagunitas </a>_Wilco Tango Foxtrot_ (American Strong Ale), <a href="http://www.lefthandbrewing.com/verify-age" target="_blank">Left Hand Brewery</a> _Wake Up Dead_ (Imperial Stout), and <a href="http://www.unibroue.com/" target="_blank">Unibroue </a>_Terrible_ (Belgian Strong Dark Ale). The toquitos and salsa were the most versatile appetizer and most stereotypical drinking grub. They went well with the <a href="http://http://asskisserales.com/" target="_blank">Ass Kisser</a> _Porter Pounder_ (Smoked Porter), [Saint Arnold][6] _Endeavor_ (Double IPA), and of course the <a href="http://www.budlight.com/" target="_blank">Bud Light</a> we dipped into once the craft brews were out. All in all it was a great night to expand our beer palates and debut some delicious new apps.
