Enchiladas Mineras are a special Mexican dish originating in Guanajuato.  Mining was and is still a large part of the economy of the city and state of Guanajuato, and miners need hearty food to replenish themselves after a hard day&#8217;s work.  These enchiladas filled with potatoes and carrots and covered with a rich red sauce certainly fit the bill, though you don&#8217;t have to be a miner to enjoy them!

### Ingredients

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;" data-mce-mark="1">1 batch <a title="Tomatillo Enchiladas" href="http://kitchen.coseppi.com/2012/05/31/tomatillo-enchiladas/">Red Enchilada Sauce</a></span>
  * [Corn tortillas][1]
  * 1 cup crumbled [queso fresco][2] or shredded Monterrey jack cheese (optional)
  * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  * 1 medium white onion, diced
  * 3 garlic cloves, minced
  * 1 pound golden potatoes, cubed
  * 1/2 pound carrots, sliced
  * 4 cups vegetable stock
  * 2 bay leaves
  * 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 1 Persian lime)
  * 1 teaspoon fresh ground cumin
  * 4-3 pickled jalapenos, sliced
  * salt to taste
  * 2 cups sliced cabbage or lettuce

### Preparation

  1. Bring potatoes, carrots, stock, and bay leaves to a simmer in a large soup pot. Cook until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the vegetables, removing the bay leaves, and set aside.
  2. In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil and saute the onions and garlic with cumin until fragrant and tender, about three minutes. Mix in the lime juice and season with salt to taste.
  3. Combine the potatoes and carrots with the sauteed onions and cheese.
  4. Pour the enchilada sauce in a shallow dish, like a pie pan. Prepare the enchiladas by coating the tortillas with sauce and then filling each with about 1/2 a cup of filling. Roll the filled enchiladas and place in a rectangular baking dish.
  5. When the dish is full, pour the remainder of the sauce over the enchiladas and bake at 350 degrees until the sauce begins to bubble, about 15 minutes.
  6. Remove the enchiladas from the oven and allow to cool for about five minutes.
  7. Serve the enchiladas over a bed of lettuce or shredded cabbage, and garnish with pickled jalapeno slices and cheese, if desired. Consider serving with fresh tomatillo salsa and [refried black beans][3].
