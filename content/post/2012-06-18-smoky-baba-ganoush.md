Baba Ganoush is kind of like hummus, but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas.  This recipe includes broiling the eggplant and using chipotle powder to give it a nice smoky flavor.  Baba ganoush is great as a dip or as a healthy alternative to mayonnaise on sandwiches.  Give it a try!

### Ingredients

  * 2 1/2 pounds purple eggplant, stemmed and halved
  * Cooking spray
  * 1/2 cup tahini
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 2 tablespoons lemon juice
  * 1 teaspoon chipotle powder
  * 3-4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * Black pepper
  * 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped

### Preparation

  1. Lightly coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.  Place the eggplant halves cut-side-down on the sheet and broil on high until the skins are evenly charred.  This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.
  2. Bake the eggplant, still cut-side-down, at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes.  The  eggplant flesh should be extremely soft at this point.
  3. Scoop the flesh of the eggplant out from the skins.  Transfer to a large blender or food processor.  Add the tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, chipotle powder, garlic, salt and several twists of black pepper from a mill.  Process until completely smooth.
  4. Transfer the puree to a large bowl and mix in the parsley.  Season with additional salt if necessary.  Let cool to room temperature or chill slightly in the refrigerator before serving.
