    Seco de Verduras with Tofu
  </p>
</div>

With the weather taking another cold turn I thought it might be a good idea to have something flavorful and hearty ready for lunch tomorrow. I have also had Peruvian food on my mind since &#8211; big announcement &#8211; per our 2013 New Year&#8217;s resolution we are putting the finishing touches on our Peruvian Vegetarian Cookbook!

Seco is a traditional Peruvian stew with a pureed cilantro base. High in the Andes it takes extra time to cook potatoes and the in the process they become extremely soft and play an important role in thickening the texture of many stews. The dish is typically prepared with chunks of chicken or beef, but our vegetarian version simply omits the meat and adds a little tofu to the deliciously tender vegetables and flavorful sauce.

### Ingredients

  * ¼ pound fresh cilantro, about 1 large bunch, washed
  * 3 cups vegetable broth, divided
  * 3 tablespoons olive oil
  * 1 medium purple onion, chopped
  * 1 medium jalapeño, chopped
  * 3 cloves garlic, minced
  * 2 cups peas (frozen or fresh – if using fresh, boil until tender)
  * 3 medium carrots, peeled and chopped
  * 2 pounds white potatoes, cut into 1 inch pieces
  * Salt and pepper to taste
  * 1-2 key limes cut into wedges
  * Prepared rice or quinoa for serving

###  Preparation

  1. Blend cilantro in a blender or food processor gradually adding about ½ cup of the broth until smooth. Set aside.
  2. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, chili pepper, and minced garlic to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until the onion is soft and translucent.
  3. Add the processed cilantro and  remaining broth to the saucepan. Add the carrots, peas, and potatoes and simmer until the potatoes are extremely soft and the broth begins to thicken- about 40 minutes.
  4. Season with salt to taste and serve with sliced lime and prepared rice or quinoa.
