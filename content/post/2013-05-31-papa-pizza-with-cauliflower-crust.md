This pizza was inspired by one we had a <a href="http://portobellopdx.com/#menu-item-549" target="_blank">Portobello</a>, a fantastic vegan restaurant in Portland. We also used it as an excuse to try our hands at a cauliflower pizza crust.

</div>

### Ingredients

**Crust**

  * 1 pound cauliflower florets, pulsed in a food processor
  * 2 tablespoons ground flax seed soaked in 3 tablespoons water
  * 1/2 cup corn meal
  * 1/2 cup flour or gluten-free flour blend
  * 1 tablespoon tapioca or rice flour
  * 2 cloves garlic
  * 1 tablespoon dry thyme
  * 3 fresh sprigs of basil
  * 4-5 fresh sage leaves
  * 1-1/2 cups water
  * salt to taste

**Pizza**

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">1/2 cup pesto</span>
  * 1 medium Yukon gold potato, extremely thinly sliced
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 2-3 large yellow onions, very thinly sliced
  * 5 dried porcini mushrooms slices, reconstituted and diced
  * 4-5 rosemary tips
  * Smoked salt

### Preparation

  1. First caramelize the onions.  Heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the onions along with a dash of salt, stirring until onions start to release liquids. Lower heat to medium low and stir occasionally until the onions are completely wilted and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. If onions begin to burn lower the heat.
  2. <span style="line-height: 13px;">While the onions caramelize  prepare the crust by combining cauliflower, ground flax, cornmeal, flours, garlic, and herbs in a food processor and blend or pulse until incorporated. Add water about 1/8th of a cup at a time until ingredients are somewhat cohesive and smooth. </span>
  3. Smooth dough in a well greased pizza or cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees until top and edges begin to brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside.
  4. Assemble the pizza by spreading the pesto evenly on top, then layer onions, mushrooms, and rosemary. Top with a layer of potato slices, a drizzle or spritz of olive oil, and a sprinkle of smoked salt.
  5. Bake at 375 until the potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes.
