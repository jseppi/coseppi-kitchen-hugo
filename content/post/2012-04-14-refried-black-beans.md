Almost every Sunday I make a giant crock pot full of beans and throughout the week James and I eat some for lunch, add them to dinner, and otherwise transform and include them in our food. They are cheap, nutritious, and delicious. Most of the time our beans don&#8217;t make it to the end of the week because at some point I get a hankering for refried beans. Refriend beans are a Tex-Mex staple and also a flavorful way to get a whole heaping of plant-based protein and plenty of fiber.

### Ingredients

  * 4 cups cooked black beans, drained
  * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  * 1/2 large onion, diced
  * 3 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  * 1 cup vegetable broth
  * Salt to taste

### Preparation

  1. Heat oil in a large soup pot and saute onions until translucent over high heat. Lower heat to medium and add garlic and cumin. Continue to saute for 2 minutes stirring frequently to prevent burning.
  2. Add beans and mash thoroughly with a potato masher, pastry cutter, or a sturdy fork.
  3. Once the beans are a more or less uniform texture, add the broth, stirring to incorporate.
  4. Season with salt to taste and serve or use as directed.
