During our 6 months of traveling in Peru, we put together a great collection of vegetarian recipes of classic Peruvian cuisine.  These recipes were informed by trips to local eateries, ingredients found in local markets, and cooking with native Peruvians. Now that we are back in the United States we are  re-testing our recipes with available ingredients and getting feedback (pun intended) from our friends and family. We are also actively seeking a publisher!
