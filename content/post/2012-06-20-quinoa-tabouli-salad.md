Our version of tabouli replaces the traditional bulgur wheat with quinoa.  This salad makes a refreshing summertime lunch, and its nutrient-dense quinoa will keep you going through the heat of the rest of the day!

### Ingredients

  * 3 cups [prepared quinoa][1] (from 1 cup uncooked quinoa)
  * 1 large bunch parsley, stemmed and chopped
  * 3 medium tomatoes, diced (about 2 cups)
  * 1 small white onion, diced (about 1 cup)
  * 3 scallions or spring onions, diced
  * 1 clove garlic, finely diced
  * 1/4 cup lemon juice
  * 4 tablespoons olive oil
  * Salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss gently.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately or slightly chilled.
