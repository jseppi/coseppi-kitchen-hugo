    Celery Root and Potato Patty
  </p>
</div>

These vegan patties were inspired by our friend and neighbor, Brian, who claims that celery root burgers are a popular food item in his home country of Denmark.  Brian sent us his notes for making patties, which we have adapted into this recipe.

We highly recommend using a food processor with a grater disk to prep the potatoes, carrot, and celery root.

### Ingredients

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">1 pound white potatoes, peeled and grated</span>
  * 3/4 pound celery root, grated
  * 1 medium carrot, grated
  * 3 servings egg replacer (such as Ener-G)
  * 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
  * 2 teaspoons salt
  * 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
  * Olive oil cooking spray

### Preparation

  1. In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes, celery root, carrot, egg replacer, and nutritional yeast. Add the salt and black pepper.
  2. Liberally coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.
  3. Using clean hands, form palm-sized patties of the mixture, about 1/2-inch thick.  Squeeze slightly to remove excess water from each patty.  Place formed patties on the baking sheet, then give the top of each a light coating of cooking spray.  This recipe makes about 6-8 patties.
  4. <span style="line-height: 13px;">Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes.  With a thin spatula, carefully flip each patty, then bake for an additional 20 minutes.</span>
  5. Enjoy as a veggie burger or by themselves!
