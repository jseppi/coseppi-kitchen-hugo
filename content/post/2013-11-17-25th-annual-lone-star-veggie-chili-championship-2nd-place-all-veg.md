    25th Annual Lone Star Veggie Chili Championship

</div>

Last Sunday, Taylor and I competed again in the <a href="http://veggiechilicookoff.com/" target="_blank">Lone Star Veggie Chili Championship</a>, America&#8217;s longest running vegetarian chili cook-off. We were joined by Taylor&#8217;s parents and her good friend Linda for a long, fun day of cooking, serving, and eating chili. Having won first place All-Veg and People&#8217;s Choice <a href="http://kitchen.coseppi.com/2012/11/11/lone-star-vegetarian-chili-cook-off/" target="_blank">last year</a>, we had a lot on the line defending our title. Due to its overwhelming success last year we decided to stick with our <a href="http://kitchen.coseppi.com/2012/11/11/lone-star-vegetarian-chili-cook-off/" target="_blank">Black Bean, Eggplant, and Lentil Chili</a> (click for the recipe!).

Our day started bright and early at 8 AM when we arrived to the competition site, had our ingredients inspected to ensure vegan-compliance, and then got to work prepping our ingredients. We then cooked our first 3-gallon batch to begin serving the public tasters at noon. Meanwhile, our second 3-gallon batch stewed away so that we would have enough to serve the hundreds of people who came by our booth until about 4 PM. At about 5 PM winners were announced by the competition&#8217;s organizer, Brendan Good of  the <a href="http://www.vegnetaustin.org/" target="_blank">Vegetarian Network of Austin</a>. Coseppi Kitchen ended up taking 2nd place in the All-Veg (no meat-substitute) division, and also 2nd place in the People&#8217;s Choice award. While we didn&#8217;t end up sweeping the competition like we did last year, we definitely felt the level of competition and quality of chilies increased this year, meaning a big win for everyone involved.

Congratulations to <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/" target="_blank">Whole Foods</a> for taking 1st place All-Veg and <a href="http://www.primarilyprimates.org/" target="_blank">Primarily Primates</a> for their People&#8217;s Choice award! Primarily Primates has a great mission of providing a sanctuary to house, protect, and rehabilitate various non-native animals (mostly apes and monkeys!).

We also want to thank <a href="http://jbgorganic.com" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garden</a> for providing such great organic vegetables for us to use in our chili!
