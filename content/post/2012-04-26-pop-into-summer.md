Here it is! April 26th and the thermostat in Austin, Texas crossed the 90 degree mark all afternoon. I know that people with a calendar in front of them or those who pay attention to the tilt of the Earth might disagree, but I am ready to officially declare summer. May the rainfall be average and the season end before October.

One of my strategies for enjoying summer is to make sure that I have plenty of cool hydrating food and drinks on hand. In Peru unchurned ice creams and frozen fruit juices are very popular year round. These treats, known as _marcianos, _are usually produced in homes and sold directly out the front door or in coolers around town. Pretty much any fruit can be used to make _marcianos_, but the most popular appeared to be coconut, _maracuya_ (passion fruit), and strawberry.

To celebrate the beginning of summer we made our own [_Maracuy y Fresa_ ][1]_[Marcianos][1]_ using passion fruit yogurt and fresh strawberries. They are a delicious and healthy way to break in a new popsicle mold and cool off, if only for a little while.
