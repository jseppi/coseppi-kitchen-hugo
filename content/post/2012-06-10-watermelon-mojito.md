Working at the farmer&#8217;s market we are often asked for cooking and recipe advice. This recipe came from our market manager, Abbi Cheek, who was asked for advice on one particularly hot afternoon.

To make watermelon puree, place sliced sections of whole watermelon in a blender and process until smooth. Then, transfer the puree to a fine mesh strainer and allow to separate for at least 10 minutes. Use the separated liquid in this recipe.

### Ingredients

  * 1 ounce simple syrup
  * 10-15 mint leaves
  * 3 or 4 ice cubes
  * 2 ounces white rum
  * 3 ounces watermelon puree
  * 2 key limes, juiced
  * 2 ounces soda water

### Preparation

  1. Muddle mint and simple syrup in a 16 ounce glass
  2. Add ice, rum, watermelon puree, and lime juice. Stir.
  3. Top with soda water and garnish with mint or a lime wedge. Serve.
