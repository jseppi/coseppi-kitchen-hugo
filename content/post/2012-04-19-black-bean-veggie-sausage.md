I don&#8217;t like to eat any food that I can&#8217;t make myself. Translation: I want to eat a whole food plant based diet and I don&#8217;t like vegan or vegetarian foods that replace meat with lab creations. This aversion, however, does not extend to gluten &#8220;meats&#8221; since 1) gluten is the protein found in wheat and you can <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2292028_make-gluten.html" target="_blank">extract at home with relative ease</a>, if you are so inclined; and  2) I am fortunate enough not to have any gluten intolerance so gluten based meat substitutes are a good source of protein in my diet.

This recipe and method for gluten and bean &#8220;sausage&#8221; are inspired by [Post Punk Kitchen][1]. This version uses black beans, ground Cayenne for heat, and substituted the thyme with Fertile Earth&#8217;s <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/94998216/organic-thyme-blend-spice-rub?ref=sr_gallery_1&ga_search_query=Organic+thyme+blend+spice+rub&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_min=0&ga_max=0&ga_search_type=handmade" target="_blank">Organic Thyme Blend Spice Rub</a>.

  * 1 teaspoon dried thyme or spice blend
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * 1 1/4 cups vital wheat gluten

### Preparation

  1. Blend beans and broth together in a food processor or blender until smooth.
  2. In a large bowl, combine the bean puree with olive oil, soy sauce, nutritional yeast, garlic, spices, and salt.  Once thoroughly combined, stir in the wheat gluten.
  3. Divide dough into 6 even portions and place the portions in individual sections of tin foil, Mold the dough into 5 inch long sausages and wrap in the tin foil.
  4. Place wrapped sausages in a steamer basket and steam for 40 minutes. Enjoy immediately or refrigerate until ready to use.

These sausages make great hotdog substitutes! We recommend them with <a href="http://www.drippinsauce.com/" target="_blank">Drippin&#8217; Sauce&#8217;s Mild Chipotle Ketchup</a> or spicy mustard.
