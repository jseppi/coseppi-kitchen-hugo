Spring in Austin can mean unpredictable weather: one day it is a sunny margarita-sipping kind of town and the next day you could be bundled up in a sweater hiding inside from a frigid downpour.Â  Spiced Carrot Bread makes use of carrots, which are locally available all spring, to create a nutritious and hearty breakfast bread that will give you the energy to brave chilly, wet spring downpours.

  * 1/2 cup pecans, chopped
  * 1/2 cup raisins, plumped
