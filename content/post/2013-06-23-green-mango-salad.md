Last weekend <a title="Austin Food Blogger Association" href="http://austinfoodbloggers.org/" target="_blank">AFBA</a> members and attendees of <a href="http://www.blogher.com/" target="_blank">BlogHer</a> were invited to an event hosted by the <a href="http://www.mango.org/" target="_blank">National Mango Board</a>. We had the opportunity to try some great mango based food and cocktails at <a href="http://www.swiftsattic.com/" target="_blank">Swift&#8217;s Attic</a> and the Mango Board was kind enough to send us a box of mangoes!  One of our gift mangoes was under-ripe which is a fantastic opportunity to create this classic southeast Asian salad.
