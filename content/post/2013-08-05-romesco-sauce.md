Romesco is a delicious Spanish sauce made with roasted peppers and nuts. It is typically thickened with bread crumbs, which don&#8217;t add anything to the flavor. To make this recipe gluten-free we just left them out. <a title="JBG" href="http://jbgorganic.com" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garden</a> has a lot of delicious sweet peppers right  now &#8211; including red carmens, orange yummies (my favorite), and yellow ringos &#8211; that would be great in this recipe. The sauce can be used in place of tomato marinara or served cold with a crudité.

### Ingredients

  * 1 pound sweet peppers, roasted and peeled
  * 1/4 pound ripe tomatoes, roasted
  * 2 medium garlic cloves, peeled
  * 1/4 cup whole blanched almonds
  * 1 tablespoons red wine vinegar
  * 1/2 tablespoon sherry (optional)
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * Salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation

  1. Pulse peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and almonds in a food processor until thoroughly chopped.
  2. Blend the ingredients and add vinegar, sherry, and olive oil.
  3. Season with salt and pepper, then serve.
