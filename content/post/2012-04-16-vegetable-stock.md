This rich vegetable stock recipe uses roasted vegetables to produce deep flavors.  If you don&#8217;t have the exact vegetables listed, you can substitute or add almost any kind of other vegetables in their place. It is a great way to use up some veggies that might be nearing the end of their refrigerator life.

### Ingredients

  * 2 medium yellow onions, peeled and cut into halves
  * 4 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch chunks
  * 3 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
  * 1 small bulb garlic, outer paper removed, bottom removed, and cut in half horizontally
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * 8 cups water
  * 1 medium (about 8 ounces) rutabaga, peeled and cut into large chunks
  * Stalks of 1 fresh fennel bulb
  * Small bunch of fresh parsley stalks
  * 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
  * Salt to taste

### Preparation

  <ol>
    <li>
      Place onion halves cut side up into a baking dish.  Low-broil in an oven for 35 to 40 minutes.  The tops should be slightly carbonized.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the onions are finished, heat the olive oil at a medium heat in a large soup pot.  Saute the celery, carrots, and garlic for about 5 minutes.

      Add the water, rutabaga, fennel stalks, parsley stalks, and black peppercorns to the sauteed vegetables.  Cover, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer.  Let simmer for 45 minutes, then salt to taste.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a colander or sieve, separate the boiled vegetables from the stock, reserving the stock.  Makes about 6 cups.
