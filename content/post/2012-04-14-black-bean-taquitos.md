Taquitos are a Tex-Mex snack in that typically consist of corn tortillas rolled around small portions of ground beef then deep fried. These little flavor bombs will fulfill anyone&#8217;s quotient for junk food particularly when dipped in to a sour cream or cheese sauce. These healthier taquitos are baked and also vegan and gluten-free.

### Ingredients

  * 2 poblano peppers, roasted and sliced
  * 2 dozen corn tortillas, softened*
  * Vegetable or olive oil cooking spray

### Preparation

  1. Roll the taquitos by placing a tablespoon of black beans and a slice of pepper in the center of a corn tortilla, fold in half, then roll tightly.
  2. Place the rolled taquitos in a large baking dish coated in cooking spray.
  3. Once the dish is full with a single layer of taquitos, liberally spray the taquitos with some additional cooking spray.
  4. Bake in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit until crispy, about 15 to 20 minutes.
