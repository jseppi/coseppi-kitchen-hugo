    Green Tomato Feast

I was wrong and I take back everything I said about green tomatoes that might have been construed as disparaging. After further experimentation I have decided that I love them! They are crisp, versatile, slightly tart globes of eating joy, and I am deeply sorry for my previous ignorance. I have found that I like them so much that I decided to try to put them in everything &#8211; and I mean _everything_.

Our latest green tomato recipes might be a good starting point for anyone who believes that they may be summoned to Kitchen Stadium. As a starter, one could recreate our [Three Bean Green Tomato Salad][1] with green tomatoes, fresh dragon tongue, green, and kidney beans, and a refreshing lemon dressing. This course could be followed by a fresh and flavorful [Green Tomato Gazpacho][2] or [Green Tomato Pesto][3] on buttery sourdough toast. For a main course why not try some flavor packed [Green Tomato Enchiladas][4] or a more delicate [Green Tomato Pizza][5]. For your final trick whip up a quick [Spiced Green Tomato and Peach Pie][6] &#8211; it works, really!
