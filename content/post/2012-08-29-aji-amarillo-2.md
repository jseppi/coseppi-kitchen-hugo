This sauce is ubiquitous in Peruvian cuisine and is used in many recipes, both for flavor and color, and as a condiment. In Peru, dried and fresh _ají amarillo_ chilies can be easily found in markets and shops throughout the country, and premade paste is also common. This recipe uses roasted orange bell peppers and fresh habanero, which are both more commonly available in North America and make an excellent flavorful substitute.

###  Ingredients

  * 1 pound (about 3 whole peppers) fresh orange bell peppers, halved and seeded
  * 1 small habanero pepper, seeded and deveined
  * 2 key limes, juiced
  * 2 cloves garlic, chopped
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * Salt to taste

### Procedure

  1. Place bell peppers face down on a lightly greased baking sheet and broil on high (about 450°F) in the oven until the pepper skins are black and blistered, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully transfer the roasted peppers to an air tight container. Allow the peppers to rest for about 10 minutes then remove the skin from the peppers.
  2. Transfer roasted and peeled bell peppers, habanero,  key lime juice, garlic, and olive oil to a high-speed blender and purée until smooth.  Salt to taste.
