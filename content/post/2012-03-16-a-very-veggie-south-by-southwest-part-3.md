On our third day of venturing into the South by Southwest jungle of music, noise, food, and people, we were ready for a bit of a low-key day to regroup before the weekend really kicks off.  Aside from seeing a few bands and enjoying a few beverages, we made it over to one of Top Chef-winner Paul Qui&#8217;s <a title="East Side King" href="http://eskaustin.com/shangri-la/" target="_blank">East Side King</a> food trucks at Shangri-la. James had the Avocado Buns &#8211; delightful vegetarian snack sandwiches consisting of a Chinese bun stuffed with grilled avocado, crunchy onions, cilantro, scallions, and some spicy mayo.  As you would expect, they were delicious!
