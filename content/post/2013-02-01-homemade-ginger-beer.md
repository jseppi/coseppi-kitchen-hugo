If you enjoy strong, spicy, full-flavored ginger ale or beer, then this recipe is for you!  Making your own ginger beer is actually pretty easy and doesn&#8217;t really require any special equipment other than an old 2-liter bottle or growler.  If you don&#8217;t know where to get dry ale yeast, try searching for a local homebrew store (such as <a title="Austin Homebrew Supply" href="http://www.austinhomebrew.com/" target="_blank">Austin Homebrew Supply</a>).

### Ingredients

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">3/4 lb fresh ginger root (use less for a less pungent end product)</span>
  * 2 quarts water
  * 1 cup turbinado sugar (white can also be used)
  * 1 lemon
  * 1/8 teaspoon dry ale yeast (such as [Danstar Nottingham][1]) *****

### Preparation

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">Give the ginger root a good wash and cut off any funky-looking skin (you can leave it mostly unpeeled).  Then cut the ginger root into rounds, about 1/8-inch thick.  Place the pieces into a large heat-resistant glass (such as Pyrex) bowl, and crush slightly using the back of a wooden spoon or a cocktail muddler.  This helps express some of the juice and aids in flavor extraction.</span>
  2. Heat the water to boiling, then pour it over the ginger in the bowl.  Add the sugar, stirring to dissolve.
  3. Use a citrus zester or [Microplane][2] to zest the entire lemon, being careful to avoid the white pith.  Juice the now-naked lemon and add 2 tablespoons of the juice to the mixture, stirring to incorporate.
  4. Let the mixture cool to room temperature (this usually takes around 1 hour), then sprinkle the yeast over the surface.
  5. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or paper towel and let sit out for 24 hours.  After a few hours you should see some yeasty activity (slight bubbling) in your bowl.
  6. After 24 hours are up, carefully strain the ginger beer into a clean 2-liter bottle or 1/2-gallon growler.  Screw on the lid tightly and let sit out for 12 &#8211; 24 hours longer.  During this time, the yeast will continue to reproduce, carbonating the ginger beer.
  
    **<span style="color: #993300;">CAUTION</span>: DO NOT LET SIT OUT FOR LONGER THAN 24 HOURS.**
  7. After this period of 24 hours, move the sealed bottle to your refrigerator, let chill, then enjoy straight or in a cocktail of your choice (I suggest a Dark and Stormy).  When you open the bottle for the first time, do it over a sink because there is a good chance it might bubble over.
  
    The ginger beer will keep in refrigerator for a long time, but you might want to open the lid every day or two to let off excess carbonation.

***** For bonus points, make your own &#8220;[ginger bug][3]&#8221; and use some of it instead of dry yeast!
