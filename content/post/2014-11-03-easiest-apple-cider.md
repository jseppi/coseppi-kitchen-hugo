Fall started in Austin last weekend which meant that it was time for me to come out of my summer hibernation. I got back on my newly refurbished bike (thanks <a href="http://peddlerbike.com/" target="_blank">Peddler</a>!) and rode it down to <a href="http://www.austineastciders.com/" target="_blank">EastCiders</a> for their first brewery tour. The brewery has been selling ciders in cans for almost  a year but this was one of the first times it was open to the public, and we enjoyed learning about their processes, trying all the ciders (except for the brisket), and  relaxing in the beautiful pavilion next to the old railway station by the brewery.

The trip and sudden autumnal onset inspired this recipe.

## Ingredients

  * 1 gallon apple cider &#8211; get the nice organic stuff that comes in a glass bottle
  * 1 packet granulated dry white wine yeast
  * Airlock with bottle stopper

## Preparation

  1. Sanitize the airlock in a diluted bleach solution and set aside.*
  2. Open the cider and add a teaspoon of the yeast granules.
  3. Inset the airlock on the bottle and store in a cool dark closet.
  4. Allow to ferment for a few days then serve!

*Sanitizing solution is 1 teaspoon bleach to 1 gallon of water. Scale as needed.
