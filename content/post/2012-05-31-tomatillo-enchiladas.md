### Ingredients

  * 1 Pound tomatillos, diced
  * 29 ounces cooked pinto beans
  * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
  * 4 cloves of garlic, minced and divided
  * 1 large yellow onion, chopped and divided
  * 1 large green bell pepper, diced
  * 2 small serrano peppers or one medium jalapeno, minced
  * 1 tablespoon ground cumin, divided
  * 2 pounds ripe tomatoes, diced
  * 1 dried chipotle, halved
  * 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
  * 12 fresh corn tortillas
  *  1/2 cup cilantro, minced and divided
  * 1 medium ripe avocado, sliced

### Preparation

  1. To start the sauce saute 3/4 of the onion and 1/2 the minced garlic in 1 tablespoon oil. Add bell pepper, minced serrano, and 1/2 a teaspoon ground cumin and cook until the peppers have softened. Add tomatoes and half of the chopped cilantro and allow the sauce to come to a simmer over medium heat. Season with salt to taste. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally while you prepare the filling.
  2. In a medium pot heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat and saute the remaining onion and garlic. Add tomatillos, pinto beans, oregano, dried chipotle, and 1/2 a teaspoon cumin. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Cook until the tomatillos have softened, about 10 minutes. Remove the chipotle from the filling and season with salt to taste.
  3.  Fill tortillas with about 1/4 of the tomatillo mixture and roll tightly and arrange in a large baking dish. When the dish is full of tortillas top with the ranchero sauce covering evenly. Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes.
  4. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Top with remaining cilantro and avocado slices. Serve warm.
