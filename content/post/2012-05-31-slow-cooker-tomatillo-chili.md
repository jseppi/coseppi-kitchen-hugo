Every Sunday we try to make something in the slow cooker that we can eat a few days for lunch. Most weeks this is some type of bean dish since beans are cheap, versatile, and delicious. This week, with the beginning of _[tomatillo][1]_ season, we decided to start this _tomatillo_ chili over night and in the morning we were greeted with delicious smells and the promise of a few good lunches to look forward to.
