    First Annual Very Veggie SXSW Thursday Brunch.
  </p>
</div>

With long lines, blazing sunshine, and long walks between venues, SXSW can be physically grueling. That is why it is important to start the day right with a healthy, well-rounded breakfast.Â  This morning we hosted a small brunch that featured locally available seasonal ingredients from <a href="http://www.jbgorganic.com/" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garde</a><a href="http://www.jbgorganic.com/" target="_blank">n</a>, the largest organic community supported agriculture farm in Texas. James and I are proud Johnson&#8217;s volunteers, and this time of year our refrigerator is flush with greens and root vegetables. With this inspiration we decided to serve a Peruvian style [Sweet Potato and Kale Tortilla][1] along with [Spiced Carrot Bread][2].

To me, there is no better way to start the day than to have a nice hot cup of coffee, but SXSW demands nutrient dense foods in addition to caffeine. We opted to compliment our meal with a classic [salty dog][3], a cocktail that make use of our wonderful seasonal Ruby Red Texas grapefruits and <a href="http://titosvodka.com/" target="_blank">Tito&#8217;s Handmade Vodka</a>, another celebrated Austin brand.
