This recipe is inspired by the hash served by the excellent <a href="http://www.broderpdx.com/" target="_blank">Broder</a> in Portland.  If you have some kind of fancy dicing tool, I highly recommend using it because dicing all those root veggies by hand is quite a task!

    Root Vegetable Hash with Sauteed Greens
  </p>
</div>

### Ingredients

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">1 1/2 pound potatoes,  1/8-inch diced</span>
  * 1/2 pound mixed other root vegetables (celery root, beet, rutabaga, and/or turnip), peeled and 1/8-inch diced
  * 1 small white onion, chopped
  * 1/4 cup fresh sage, chopped
  * 1 cup dandelion greens, shredded
  * 1 cup dino kale, shredded
  * 1 cup purple cabbage, shredded
  * 5  tablespoon olive oil, divided
  * 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
  * 1/4 cup [pickled beets][1], diced
  * Salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation

  1.  In a large soup pot, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add diced root vegetables and onions and saute uncovered. Stir occasionally until vegetables are caramelized and tender, about 30 minutes. Add sage, remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  If you don&#8217;t have a large enough pot, feel free to do the hash in smaller batches, then reheat after all the batches are cooked.
  2. White the hash is cooking, heat remaining olive oil in a wok or soup pot over medium-high heat. Add shredded dandelion greens, kale, and cabbage.  Stir continuously until the greens reduce in volume by 2/3 and are tender, about 5 minutes. Finish with apple cider vinegar, remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, and set aside.
  3. When the hash is finished, serve topped with greens and pickled beets.
