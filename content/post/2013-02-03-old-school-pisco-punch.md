This old school San Francisco-style Pisco Punch is sure to be a hit at your next fancy (or not so fancy) party!  To properly prepare it, you will need to give yourself at least 3 days advance notice so the ingredients can adequately meld and mingle.  This punch can be served either in a punch bowl or by the glass.  For this recipe and lots of other great classics, check out _[Imbibe!][1] _by David Wondrich.

### Ingredients

  * 1 pineapple, <a title="Video: How to Peel a Pineapple" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45YUO0sLQYI" target="_blank">peeled</a> and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
  * 2 cups turbinado sugar
  * 2 cups water
  * 1 750-ml bottle of Pisco
  * 7 lemons

### Preparation

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">Place the pineapple chunks in a large bowl.  In a separate pot, bring the water to  boil, turn off heat, add sugar, and stir until completely dissolved.  Pour this simple syrup mixture over the pineapple chunks.  Let cool, cover, and then refrigerate for about 24 hours.</span>
  2. The following day, use a fine mesh strainer to separate the syrup (which now will have a delicious pineapple flavor) from the sweetened pineapple chunks.  Store the pineapple chunks in an airtight container in the refrigerator
  3. In another jar or large bottle, combine the entire bottle of pisco with 1 cup of the pineapple syrup.  Store this mixture in the refrigerator for at least 2 days before using (it should last for weeks &#8211; the longer the better). Store the remaining syrup in a jar in the refrigerator (it is great for tiki drinks!).
  4. On the day you are serving the punch, you can either serve in a large punch bowl or by the glass: 
      * **In a Punch Bowl**: Combine the pisco-syrup mixture with 16-ounces cold, filtered water, and the juice of all 7 lemons.  If desired, sweeten with more of the leftover pineapple syrup.  Add a large block of ice (see note below), and serve in small punch glasses, garnished with a few of the sweetened pineapple chunks.
      * **By the Glass**: Combine 2 ounces pisco-syrup mixture, 3/4 ounce filtered water, and 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice in a shaker with several cubes of ice.  Shake vigorously, then strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with a couple chunks of sweetened pineapple.

**Note &#8211; Making a Block of Ice:**  We&#8217;ve found the easiest way to make a punch bowl-sized block of ice is to use an empty milk or juice carton.  Just cut the top off, clean the inside with warm water, fill with filtered water, and freeze.  It will probably take at least 12 hours to freeze solid, so take this into consideration when planning your punch party.
