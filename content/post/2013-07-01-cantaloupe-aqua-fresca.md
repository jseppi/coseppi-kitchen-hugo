This tasty and simple beverage is actually something I learned back in high school. My good friend Patrick often invited me to his large Filipino family&#8217;s parties. These parties were some of my first experiences with real, homemade international foods. This cantaloupe drink was a treat at almost every gathering I remember.

I never found out a special Tagalog name for this drink, so I&#8217;m calling it an aqua fresca for its similarity to the light Mexican beverages. Either way, this melon juice a delicious and refreshing treat on hot summer days!

### Ingredients

  * 1 large cantaloupe
  * 1/2 cup sugar
  * 4-5 cups water

### Preparation

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">Cut the cantaloupe in half, and scoop out seeds into a mesh strainer. Â Put the strainer over a large bowl so you can catch the juice that comes out.</span>
  2. Peel the cantaloupe, then grate it using a cheese grater. Make sure to save any juice that is expressed during the grating.
  3. Dissolve the sugar in 2 cups of the water.
  4. Add about half of the grated cantaloupe to a large pitcher.
  5. Add the remaining cantaloupe to the strainer with the seeds, pour the sugar water over this, then use a large wooden spoon to press the flesh against the strainer, squeezing out as much juice as possible. Add all of this juice along along with the remaining water to the pitcher.
  6. Refrigerate until cold or serve with lots of ice!
