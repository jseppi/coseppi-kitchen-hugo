Dandelion greens are from the chicory family and while delicious, can be a bit too bitter for some people.  The use of tomatoes in this dish helps cut the bitterness.  If you don&#8217;t have any cultivated dandelion greens (don&#8217;t use the ones growing in your yard!), you can substitute other greens like chard or spinach.

For this meal, you&#8217;ll need either an oven-proof skillet or a separate dish you can bake in.
