If you need extra protein this is a good way to go.

### Ingredients

<div>
  2 cups old fashioned oats

  2 cups soy flour
</div>

<div>
  1/4 cup ground flax seeds
</div>

<div>
  1/2 cup dehydrated blueberries
</div>

<div>
  1/2 cup brown sugar
</div>

<div>
  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

  1 lemon, zest
</div>

<div>
  1 lemon, juiced
</div>

### Preparation

1. In a large bowl combine oats, soy flour, flax seed, blueberries, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and milk alternative. The resulting dough should be similar to oatmeal cookie dough.

3. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before storing in an airtight container.
