    Red Wine Reduction Sauce
  </p>
</div>

This sauce is typically served with meat, but it makes a great gravy-like sauce any savory dish. It makes about 1/3 a cup of thick sauce.

### Ingredients

  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * 1/2 white onion, minced
  * 2 cloves garlic
  * 2 medium carrots
  * 1 medium leek
  * 1 sprig rosemary
  * 2 cups vegetable stock
  * 1 cup dry red wine
  * 2 tablespoons tomato paste

### Â Preparation

  1. Heat olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, carrots, and leeks and saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
  2. Add rosemary, broth, wine, and tomato paste to the sauteed vegetables. Combine and bring to a rolling boil.
  3. Cook until reduced by half, about 45 minutes. Drain the vegetables and return the sauce to a pan.
  4. Bring the sauce back to a boil and allow to continue to reduce until the sauce reaches the desired consistency, about 30 minutes.
