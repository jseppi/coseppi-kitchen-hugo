Trumpet mushrooms are used in this dish mainly because of their shape which, when sliced, look somewhat like scallops. I have no idea what scallops taste like, but if they are tender and mild then trumpet mushrooms are not a bad substitute.

### Ingredients

  * 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
  * 1/4 cup soy sauce (gluten-free if required)
  * 1 teaspoon brown sugar
  * 2 1/2 cups water
  * 1 1/4 pounds trumpet mushrooms, cut into 3/4 inch thick rounds
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
  * 2 medium leeks, washed and sliced
  * salt and pepper to taste
  * 1 lemon, sliced into wedges

### Preparation

  1. Mix rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, and water until the sugar dissolves at least four hours.
  2. To cook the mushrooms heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet until very hot. Carefully place the marinaded mushroom slices in the pan and season with ground pepper and a sprinkle of salt. Allow the bottom of the mushroom slices to cook until a good sear forms, about 3 minutes.
  3. Turn the mushrooms, season, and sear the other side.
  4. While the mushrooms are cooking heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute the leeks until just tender, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
  5. Plate the dish with 3 seared mushroom slices served over a 1/4 cup of sauteed leeks and a lemon wedge.
