Muhammara is a delectable dip, typically made with roasted aleppo peppers, walnuts, and lemon juice. Being in Texas, however, we mixed things up a bit and used sweet Carmen peppers (from <a title="JBG Organic" href="http://www.jbgorganic.com" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garden</a>), pecans, and key lime juice.  The result is amazing!  Note that this recipe calls for pomegranate molasses, which really are a key ingredient.  Look for them at your local Mediterranean grocer (such as <a title="Phoenicia Bakery and Deli" href="http://www.phoeniciabakery.com/" target="_blank">Phoenicia</a> in Austin) or in the international food aisle of your grocery store.  You could also use reduced balsamic vinegar as a substitute.  If you can&#8217;t find Carmen peppers, use 2 to 3 large red bell peppers in their place.

### Ingredients

  * 5 Carmen peppers
  * Cooking spray
  * 1 cup pecans
  * 2 medium cloves garlic
  * 1 tablespoon harissa or 1 teaspoon hot pepper powder
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses
  * 1/4 cup fresh key lime juice (about 6 key limes)
  * Salt to taste

### Preparation

  1.  Place the peppers on a baking sheet and coat lightly with cooking spray.  Broil on high, turning peppers occasionally, until the skins are blistered and blackened evenly.  Place the blackened peppers in a large bowl, cover, and let them steam themselves for about 5 minutes.  Remove the stems, seeds, and skins from all the peppers.
  2. In a large pan, lightly toast the pecans.  Don&#8217;t burn them, but get a nice even toast so that the pecans become slightly fragrant.
  3. Place skinned peppers, toasted pecans, garlic, harissa, olive oil, pomegranate molasses, and lime juice in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Salt to taste.  Serve with pita, crackers, sliced cucumbers, or use as a sandwich spread!
