All of that chanting, tweeting, and milling around can take a lot of energy, and while many Austin eateries have shown support, some activists with special dietary preferences may want to pack a lunch. So in between donated goodies from <a href="http://eastsidepies.com/" target="_blank">East Side Pies</a> and <a href="http://www.cookiedelivery.com/" target="_blank">Tiff&#8217;s Treats</a>, activists with a kitchen at their disposal may want to try these quick, nourishing, and durable recipes.

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;"><a title="Chickpea “Tuna” Salad" href="http://kitchen.coseppi.com/2013/04/14/chickpea-tuna-salad/">Chickpea &#8220;Tuna&#8221; Salad</a> &#8211; This is a versatile protein-packed vegan, gluten-free salad that packs well in a sandwich or with some crackers or carrot sticks.<br /> </span>
  * [May Lentil Loaf][1] &#8211; This takes a little more time to make, but I imagine it as a modern day loaves and fishes&#8211; if you bring a lentil loaf to a march or committee hearing you can feed yourself and your new closest 40 friends a hearty, delicious, energy-packed meal.
  * [Mujadara][2] &#8211; More nutrient dense lentils! This middle eastern salad is good hot or cold and tastes great on its own, on salads, or in pita.
  * [Blueberry Oat Protein Bars][3] &#8211; This is a good one to have in your back pocket. Munch one before you link arms and you will be full and satisfied all the way to county lock up.
  * [Sweet Potato and Broccoli Pasties][4] &#8211; This dish was traditionally made by women first thing in the morning for the menfolk heading off to the factories and mines. Maybe sometime in the next 30 days some helpful allies can whip these up for women marching off in the bowels of the capitol extension.
  * [Kabocha Squash and Quinoa Tamales][5] with [Aji][6] &#8211; Tamales are great to-go foods and the squash (available now from [Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garden][7]) helps keep the dough moist, adds a healthy veggie, and a delicious flavor.
  * [Quinoa Tabouli Salad][8] &#8211; Quinoa is a super food for the wonder women (and men) that need all the help they can get. This salad will hold up will for several hours in a backpack. Consider pairing with the Mujadara in a pita pocket with some [hummus][9] and you&#8217;ll have what it takes to shout for days.
  * [Veggie Spring Rolls][10] &#8211; Spring rolls are a great way to eat a lot of veggies. If you are packing them for lunch or a snack minimize the amount of liquid in the rolls. Don&#8217;t forget your protein-loaded [peanut sauce][11].
  * [Barton Creek Market Bars][12] &#8211; It will be hard to keep going without something sweet. These bars satisfy the need for a nice treat while still giving you the energy and nutrition your body (and cause) needs.
  * [Pistachio Biscotti][13] &#8211; Biscotti are a great snack, pair well with your first (or fifth) coffee, and will last for days moving from the temperature differential of the South Lawn to the Senate Chamber.
