This Greek-inspired salad uses a healthy portion of one of the most nutritious herbs that you&#8217;ve probably never heard of (though you might have seen growing in your sidewalk) &#8211; <a title="Purslane on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portulaca_oleracea#Culinary_usage" target="_blank">purslane</a>!

Serve this salad as part of a nice home _Meze _platter, along with dolmas, [hummus][1], pita, [baba ganoush][2], and some olives for a refreshing Mediterranean meal.

### Ingredients

  * 2 medium tomatoes, diced
  * 1 medium cucumber, peeled (optionally) and diced
  * 1 cup purslane leaves
  * 2 cups arugula
  * 4 ounces feta, chunked or broken into small pieces
  * 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (~2 lemons)
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * Salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation

  1. In a large bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, cucumber, purslane leaves, arugula, and feta.
  2. Whisk together the lemon juice and olive oil, then pour over the vegetables.  Toss to coat.
  3. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
