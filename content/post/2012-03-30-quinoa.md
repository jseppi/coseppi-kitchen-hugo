Quinoa (_quinua_ in Spanish) is a nutrient-rich vegan, gluten-free protein source with origins in the high Andes.  It was readily available in Peruvian markets and featured on many menus in soups, entrees, even _refrescos_. Quinoa is becoming more and more common in the United States where it can be found on health-food aisles of many grocery stores or in the bulk-foods section. However, if you are having trouble locating this healthy, versatile, and delicious seed where you live, it is also available online: [Amigo Foods][1], [Amazon.com][2], [Nutricity.com][3]

### Preparation

Use a 1-to-2 ratio of uncooked, pre-rinsed quinoa to water.  Boil quinoa in water in an uncovered pot.  Once water comes to a boil, cover with a securely fitting lid, reduce heat to low, and let simmer for 12-15 minutes.

1 cup of uncooked quinoa will yield about 3 cups of cooked quinoa.
