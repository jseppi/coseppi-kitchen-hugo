A _causa_ is a Peruvian dish that involves sandwiching some kind of salad (typically tuna and tomato) between two layers of mashed and seasoned yellow potatoes.  _Causas_ are great for bringing to parties or potlucks, as they are like a de/re-constructed potato salad.  In this vegan version of _causa_, we made the filling from seasonal spring vegetables from our favorite Austin farm, <a href="http://www.jbgorganic.com/" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garden</a>.

### Ingredients

  * 4 pounds yellow potatoes, peeled and chunked
  * 3 tablespoons _<a title="Ají Amarillo" href="http://kitchen.coseppi.com/2012/03/aji-amarillo/" target="_blank">ají amarillo</a>_ paste
  * 4 medium carrots, peeled and diced
  * 4 medium sweet radishes, diced
  * 2 cups curly kale, stems removed and leaves diced
  * 1/2 cup parsley, diced
  * 1/4 cup spring onions, diced
  * Juice of 3 key limes
  * 1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise
  * Salt and pepper to taste
  * Paprika for garnish

### Preparation

  1. Boil potato chunks until soft throughout.   Mash the cooked potato chunks with the _<a title="ají amarillo" href="http://kitchen.coseppi.com/2012/03/aji-amarillo/" target="_blank">ají amarillo</a>_ paste until smooth.  Season to taste and set aside to cool.
  2. In a large bowl, combine the diced carrots, radishes, kale, vegan mayonnaise, parsley, spring onions, and key lime juice.  Toss the mixture until vegetables are evenly coated with the vegan mayonnaise.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
  3. In a deep (about 3-inch) rectangular dish, make an even layer using 1/2 of the mashed potatoes.
  4. Spread the vegetable mixture on top of the bottom layer of mashed potatoes.
  5. Use the remaining mashed potatoes to make an even layer on top of the vegetable mixture.  Dust with paprika and chill slightly before serving.  Serve by cutting approximately 3-inch-by-3-inch squares with a flat spatula.
