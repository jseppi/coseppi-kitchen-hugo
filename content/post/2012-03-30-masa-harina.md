_Masa harina_ is a type of corn flour that is used to make a wide range of Latin American foods including Mexican corn tortillas and tamales. Unlike ordinary corn meal, the kernels used to create _masa harina_ are treated with slacked lime prior to grinding. The resulting corn flour has a fine texture and reconstitutes to make a very smooth dough. It also has more nutritional value than corn meal or flour that has not been treated with the calcium rich lime.

_Masa harina_ is widely available in many parts of the United States in grocery stores but it is also inexpensive and quite accessible online.
