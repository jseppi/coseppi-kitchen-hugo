There are two great veggie-centric events going on in Austin this weekend:

[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-471" title="poster_thumb" src="{{% mediaroot %}}uploads/2012/03/poster_thumb-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" srcset="{{% mediaroot %}}uploads/2012/03/poster_thumb-194x300.jpg 194w, {{% mediaroot %}}uploads/2012/03/poster_thumb.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" />][1]**Saturday March 30, 2012** we will be volunteering at [Texas VegFest][1] at Fiesta Gardens from 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The event promotes and celebrates plant-based diets for a healthier future and featuresÂ  more than 100 vendors, activities, and great local bands and speakers including one of my favorites, [Michael Greger, MD][2] of [www.NutritionFacts.org][2]. There is a recommended donation of $5.

**Sunday March 31, 2012** we strongly encourage you to checkout the [JBG Spring Potluck and Open House][3]. The potluck runs from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM and is a great chance to take your friends and family out to the farm and enjoy and share some great food. Free of charge, BYOB, and bring a dish to share. We will be preparing one of our favorite recipes from [The Authentic Peruvian Vegetarian Cookbook][4] for everyone and the farm will be providing free heirloom tomato transplants for all in attendance!
