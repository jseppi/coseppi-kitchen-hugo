<img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://veggiechilicookoff.com/newimages/lsvcco25_logo.jpg" width="200" height="210" />This coming **Sunday, November 10**, is the <a href="http://veggiechilicookoff.com/" target="_blank">25th Annual Lone Star Veggie Chili Championship</a>! This year&#8217;s competition will be held from **12pm til 5pm** at 4301 West William Cannon at MoPac here in Austin (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/mwpE0" target="_blank">map</a>).

Taylor and I will be competing again this year, but this time with a title to defend (<a href="http://kitchen.coseppi.com/2012/11/11/lone-star-vegetarian-chili-cook-off/" target="_blank">we won</a> the All-Veg division and the People&#8217;s Choice award last year)!

This long-running chili competition features all vegan chili from teams around Texas and beyond, and is sure to be a great time. Whether you&#8217;re vegetarian or not, come on out to have fun, taste and learn about delicious vegetarian food, and vote for your favorite team (which we hope will be us)!

Also, if you&#8217;d like to compete, <a href="http://veggiechilicookoff.com/contestant-reg/" target="_blank">registration</a> is currently still open.

Hope to see you there!
