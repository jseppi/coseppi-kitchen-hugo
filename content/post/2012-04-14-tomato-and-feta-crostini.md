Crostini are wonderful little appetizers. These use slices of baked tomatoes which are extremely flavorful.

### Ingredients

  * 1 baguette, cut into quarter-inch thick rounds
  * 2 pounds roma tomatoes, cut into quarter-inch thick slices
  * Salt
  * Few fresh sprigs rosemary
  * 4 ounces feta cheese, cut or crumbled into small pieces
  * Olive oil
  * Fresh ground black pepper, to taste

### Preparation

  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Place roma tomatoes into a deep baking dish or two.  Drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil and lightly salt. Bake for one hour.  Ideally the tomatoes will have some slight carbonizing on their bottoms.  Use a stiff spatula to scrape the tomatoes from the pan(s), being careful to keep them relatively intact.
  2. Heat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  Place baguette rounds on a baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes.  Remove from oven, keeping the toasted baguette pieces on the baking sheet, then drizzle (or spray) lightly with olive oil.
  3. After the tomatoes and baguettes have finished, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a small pan on high heat.  Quickly fry the rosemary in the hot oil, about 30 seconds.  Remove rosemary and place on a paper towel to soak up excess oil.  You can save the excess oil, now flavored with rosemary, for another dish.
  4. Place baked tomato slices on toasted baguette rounds.  Add a few of the fried rosemary leaves to each crostini.  Top each with a small amount of feta and season with ground black pepper.
  5. Set oven to high broil.  Broil the crostini on the top rack of the oven for three minutes.
