Caramelized onions have an incredibly rich flavor and a texture that just melts in your mouth.  Properly caramelizing onions is a very long process, but the result is completely worth it.  The allspice berries give the onions a nice aroma and slight floweriness.

### Ingredients

  * 2 pounds onions, sliced into rings
  * 2 tablespoons + 1/3 cup olive oil
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * 5 allspice berries
  * 1 baguette, sliced diagonally into 1/4-inch thick pieces
  * 1 roll chevre goat cheese

### Preparation

  1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat in a large pan.  Once it is hot, add the onions, but do not have them more than half an inch thick &#8211; you can add more as the onions cook down.  Reduce the heat to medium, add the salt, and let the onions reduce.  Continue to add sliced raw onions in batches until all are reduced.
  2. Add the allspice berries, reduce heat to very low, and continue cooking, stirring often, until the onions are caramelized.  This will take 40 minutes to 1 hour.  Remember to keep the heat low and be patient.  Remove allspice berries once onions are finished cooking.
  3. While the onions are cooking, lay the sliced baguette onto a baking sheet.  Use a brush to lightly coat the top of each piece with the remaining olive oil.  Toast in an oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
  4. Once the onions and bread are finished, put a small amount of caramelized onion on each piece of toast.  Put a small piece of chevre on top of each crostini.  Place back in oven for about 5 minutes.  Let cool slightly, then serve.
