    Molletes &#8211; a hearty breakfast!
  </p>
</div>

The first time we had molletes I thought that our hostess was being creative on behalf of the vegetarians, but it turns out that this is an easy, tasty breakfast common around central Mexico. We have had them made with traditional _bolillo_ bread which we can get hot and fresh at our local Hispanic supermarket, Fiesta. _Bolillo_ are a lot like french bread rolls so I would recommend a hearty and crusty bread if you cannot find bolillos locally.

### Ingredients

  * <span style="line-height: 13px">2 <em>bolillos</em>, halved (or four thick slices of french bread)</span>
  * 2 cups refried beans
  * 1/2 cup [fresh cheese][1] or grated Monterrey jack (optional)

### Preparation

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px">Spread the refried beans evenly among the four slices of bread and top with the cheese. </span>
  2. Bake in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until the cheese is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
  3. Serve hot with guacamole, pico de gallo, or a salsa of your choice.
