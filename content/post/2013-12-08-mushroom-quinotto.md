Quinotto is quinoa cooked in the style of [risotto][1]. Unlike rice, however, quinoa will not become creamy with this method, so we use a puree of tofu and raw cashews to add creaminess to this protein-packed entree.

### Ingredients

  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 3-4 shallots, diced
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * 12 ounces mixed mushrooms (cremini and chanterelles work well), sliced
  * cream sherry or white wine
  * 6 cups vegetable or mushroom broth, warmed
  * 2 cups uncooked quinoa (tricolor works well and looks pretty)
  * 8 ounces firm tofu
  * 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked in warm water for about 20 minutes
  * Salt
  * Black truffle or truffle oil (optional)

### Preparation

  1. Â In a large skillet, saute shallots and garlic in olive oil over medium-high heat until the shallots are translucent, about 5 minutes.
  2. Add the mushrooms and continue to saute until the mushrooms are thoroughly cooked down, about 10 minutes.
  3. Add the sherry or wine, stirring until it has all been absorbed or evaporated. Transfer sauteed shallots and mushrooms to a bowl.
  4. In the same skillet, add the quinoa and lightly toast for about 30 seconds, stirring to prevent burning.
  5. Add 2 cups of broth, increase heat to bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer, stirring often.
  6. Once most of the liquid has been absorbed/evaporated, add about 1/2 cup more, reduce again, and repeat until the quinoa is just about finished. This process might not use all 6 cups of broth, but should be close.
  7. In a food processor, process tofu and soaked cashews until smooth. Add this mixture along with the shallots and mushrooms to the quinoa. Stir to fully incorporate and heat until warmed throughout. Season to taste.
  8. Serve with a few truffle shavings or a light drizzle of truffle oil.
