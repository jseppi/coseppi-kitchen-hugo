_Mirepoix_ is the aromatic flavor trinity of celery, carrot, and onion used as a base in typical French cuisine.

This simple bean soup replaces common celery with the stalks and leaves of its more pungent cousin, **celeriac** (often called celery root) in the _mirepoix._ If you are in Austin, <a title="JBG Organic" href="http://jbgorganic.com" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s Backyard Garden </a>recently started selling this delicious herb at <a title="Austin Farmers' Markets" href="http://www.edibleaustin.com/content/farmers-markets-resources-109" target="_blank">farmers&#8217; markets</a> around town.
