</div>

Chilaquiles are a traditional Mexican breakfast that use leftover or stale corn tortillas. There are hundreds of different ways to make chilaquiles in as many different sauces &#8211;  our recipe cuts down on some of the oil that may typically be used and boosts the flavor with a fresh, tangy salsa verde.

### Ingredients

  * 1 pound tomatillos, husked, washed, and halved
  * 2 key limes, juiced
  * 1 dozen stale [corn tortillas][1], cut into 1-inch-wide strips
  * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  * 1 medium white onion, diced
  * 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground cumin
  * 1/2 jalapeno, diced
  * 1/8 cup cilantro, chopped
  * Salt to taste

### Preparation

  1. To make the sauce, place the halved tomatillos on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees until the skin of the tomatillos is starts to brown, about 20 minutes. Scrape the entire contents of the baking sheet including any juices into a blender and puree with the lime juice. Season with salt to taste then set this salsa verde aside.
  2. In a large pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Saute the tortilla pieces, stirring constantly, until they begin to crisp, about two minutes. Add onion, cumin, and jalapeno to the fried tortillas and continue to saute until the onions are tender, about three minutes.
  3. Stir the salsa verde and cilantro into the saute and bring to a simmer.
  4. Serve immediately with avocado slices, [refried beans][2], additional salsa, or a sprinkle of cheese.
