I do not believe that I have ever had a vegan mac and &#8220;cheese&#8221; that tastes like the original, but that does not mean that they are not also good. This recipe creates a savory sauce with mushrooms, nutritional yeast, and Peruvian Aji Amarillo and ups the nutritional ante with fresh broccoli and quinoa.
