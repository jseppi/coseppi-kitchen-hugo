It took me a long time to get around to appreciating smoked spices. My reluctance is the same thing that make so many people love them: smoky flavors remind me of meat. But, I am growing up and trying new things and after enough coxing I have learned to appreciate smoked spices. I am even considering making my own using the same grill method described in <a href="http://www.culturecheesemag.com/can_do/spring_2012/homemade_smoker" target="_blank">Culture Magazine to smoke cheese</a>. Look for an update on this experiment on our News page in the weeks to come.

For now I am using trader <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article.asp?article_id=149" target="_blank">Joe&#8217;s South African Smoke Seasoning Blend</a>, but any smoked seasoning will do. Just remember, a little will go a long way.

### Ingredients

  * 2 cups of cooked black beans, drained
  * 1/4 cup vegetable stock
  * 1 clove garlic
  * 1/4 teaspoon smoked spice
  * salt to taste

### Preparation

  1. Combine ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt to taste.
