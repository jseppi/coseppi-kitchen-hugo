This past Sunday at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MuellerFarmersMarket" target="_blank">Mueller Farmers&#8217; Market</a> there was a vendor selling the Peruvian purple corn drink _Chicha Morada._ At the same time <a href="http://daidueaustin.net/" target="_blank">Dai Due</a> was selling a beet soda. This is how inspiration is born.  Our Beet-cha Morada is a light, refreshing drink with a beautiful purple-red hue.
